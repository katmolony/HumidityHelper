Maintaining an optimal level of humidity inside a home is essential for the well-being of both the occupants and the structure of the building.

To address these risks, it's recommended to keep indoor humidity levels in the range of 30-50%. This can be achieved through the use of humidifiers or dehumidifiers, depending on the specific needs of the environment. Regular monitoring of humidity levels and addressing any issues promptly can help mitigate potential risks.

You device can:
- read indoor and outdoor weather conditions
- display these conditions
- upload these readings to be analysed
- assess when is the best time to activate humidity devices
- gives accesses to other forms of analysis
