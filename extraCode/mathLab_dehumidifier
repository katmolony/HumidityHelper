% Function to calculate dew point
function dewPoint = calculateDewPoint(temperature, humidity)
    % Implement the dew point calculation based on your chosen formula
    % For example, you can use the Magnus formula
    % Dew point calculation code goes here
    
    % Replace the following line with the actual dew point calculation
    dewPoint = temperature - (100 - humidity) / 5;
